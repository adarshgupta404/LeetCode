The idea here is to use addition efficiently to compute the final result...
we know that division can be done using addition or subtraction...
for example 20/3 = 3+3+3+3+3+3+(2, ignored) (result is 6 times 3 hence 6)

Hence the loop is run, n times where n is our result...
To more efficiently compute this, we can reduce the loops to log n time by adding divisor everytime it is added on...

So 20/3 = 3 + 6 + 12 + (24, ignore) (curr result is 2^(3-1)=4, 3 here is number of iterations...)
left over sum, 20-12 = 8, and we repeat the process...
So 8/3 = 3 + 6 + (12, ignore) (this time result is 2^(2-1)=2, 2 here is number of iterations...)
left over sum, 8-6 = 2, since 2 is less than 3, we terminate the process...

Hence final result is 4+2 = 6
